# phase-1-cumulative-project
End of Flatiron Phase 1 project.

Our initial idea is to create a story generator, similar to the mad libs we made as kids. The user will be required to enter 5 words that relate to the part of speech required (adjective, noun, verb) and from there, a story will be generated using the words entered. The event listeners that we will use are submit (submission of words), click (options to like each story that has been submitted, and see other user's story submissions), and mouseover (hold mouse over each part of speech to see the definition and/or example). 

If we can figure it out, we would like to use AI to generate an image based off of each sentence created. 

The purpose of our project is entertainment, as well as the ability to share created stories with all users visiting the site.


Story:

This year, my family is hosting Thanksgiving at my sister's house. She always makes a big deal about bringing a gift or dish, so this year I decided to bring a __noun(singular)__ . Last year, my brother brought __noun(plural)__, and my sister was NOT happy.

As the day approached, I carefully prepared my surprise dish, a secret weapon to dazzle the family taste buds. The anticipation grew as I  __verb(past tence)__ on my way to my sister's home, armed with my mysterious creation. Little did they know, a culinary masterpiece awaited them.

To everyone's surprise, my dish turned out to be __adjective__ ! The unique flavors and textures were a __adjective__ addition to the traditional spread. This Thanksgiving, my unexpected contribution became a highlight, turning the table into a feast of culinary surprises.



Guidelines:

1. User has 5 question boxes that require an noun, verb, or adjective to be entered. 
2. Directly below the question box, the type of word to be entered will be stated (example: "Noun (singular)"), and when the user "mouses over" the type of word, an alert will pop up giving the definition of noun, verb, etc. 
3. User clicks the box, enters in their word, then submits. 
4. After all words are submitted, they will populate in their respective places throughout the blurred out story to the right of the Question boxes. 
5. To reveal their completed story, the user will need to click the "Show Story" button at the buttom of the page. 

Extras: 
6. (+) The user can click a "Save" button which will post their story to the page so future users can compare stories. 
7. (+) Stories will be held in a drop down menu on the top left of the page so that they can't see what the story is prior to creating their own.
