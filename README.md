# phase-1-cumulative-project
End of Flatiron Phase 1 project.

For our Phase 1 Project, Ricardo and I created a random story generator, similar to the mad libs we made as kids. The user will be required to enter words that relate to the part of speech it's asking for (adjective, noun, verb) and from there, a unqiue story will be generated. The event listeners that we will use are submit (submission of words), click (options to like other users submissions), and mouseover (hold mouse over each part of speech to see the definition and/or example). 

The purpose of our project is entertainment, as well as the ability to share created stories with all users visiting the site.




Guidelines:

1. User has 6 question boxes that require an amimal, name, noun, verb, or adjective to be entered. 
2. Directly above the text box, the part of speech to be entered will be stated (example: "Noun (singular)"), and when the user "mouses over" the part of speech, a box will pop up providing the definition.  
3. User clicks the box, enters in their word, then submits. 
4. After all words are submitted, a randomized story will populate with their input displayed in lime green.
5. Their story will immediately be posted towards the bottom of the page. 
6. Users are able to like and dislike their own, or other users stories. 

Extras: 
7. (+) There is a surprise button at the bottom of the page...
